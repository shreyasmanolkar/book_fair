It is suggestive rather than explanatory, its object being to stimulate men and women to the discovery and perception of the truth that-- "They themselves are makers of themselves." By virtue of the thoughts, which they choose and encourage; that mind is the master-weaver, both of the inner garment of character and the outer garment of circumstance, and that, as they may have hitherto woven in ignorance and pain they may now weave in enlightenment and happiness.'

    'The book is the story of a person (the narrator and author) who has two fathers: the first was his biological father – the poor dad - and the other was the father of his childhood best friend, Mike – the rich dad. Both fathers taught the author how to achieve success but with very disparate approaches. It became evident to the author which fathers approach made more financial sense. Throughout the book, the author compares both fathers – their principles, ideas, financial practices, and degree of dynamism and how his real father, the poor and struggling but highly educated man, paled against his rich dad in terms of asset building and business acumen.'

Sir Stei, recognizing the inestimable value of the only work of its kind, succeeded in publishing the critical edition of the text as in 1892 which has been printed here as Vol. III. Later he followed this illustrious venture by presenting a fully annotated translation of the Chronicle, in two volumes, printed as Vol. I and Vol. II, the former containing the translation of the first seven tarangas from the original Sanskrit and the later that of the remaining eighth taranga'

The wisdom distilled in this accessible, profound, and engaging book offers readers the opportunity to achieve nothing less than a life of joy.'

This piece of work recounts his ideas on the process of evolution of living beings based on the process of natural selection and it laid down the foundation for evolutionary biology. Initially published for literary reasons, Charles Darwins standing in the scientific circles drew attention to its contents. Inviting criticism from religious circles for its controversial conclusion, the Origin of Species was later accepted by the experts and several theories have been built upon it as addition to the field of evolutionary biology.'
